# Project: ProteomeXchange Data Analysis (Research/Academic Project)

## Overview / Summary

This project, undertaken at UConn I3, involved modernizing a legacy application for ProteomeXchange data analysis. The original application utilized an older React frontend and a core C-based algorithm for analyzing over-represented proteomes or motifs, containerized with Ansible. The primary goal was to update the technology stack, improve maintainability, and streamline deployment. The modernized application, now deployed at [https://www.proteome-x.com/](https://www.proteome-x.com/), features a Laravel backend, a contemporary React UI, and the same C algorithm containerized with Docker, all running on an Ubuntu server. This modernization effort was completed in 2023.

## Research Question / Objectives

*   **Problem:** The existing ProteomeXchange analysis tool was built on an outdated React version, used Ansible for containerizing a C algorithm, and needed a significant refresh to improve its maintainability, user experience, and deployment process.
*   **Objective 1:** Re-architect the application with a modern backend framework, selecting Laravel (PHP) for its robustness and ecosystem.
*   **Objective 2:** Develop a new, modern React frontend to enhance user interaction and interface design.
*   **Objective 3:** Preserve the core scientific integrity by continuing to use the existing C-based algorithm for proteome/motif analysis.
*   **Objective 4:** Modernize the deployment strategy by containerizing the C algorithm using Docker, replacing the older Ansible orchestration.
*   **Objective 5:** Deploy the full application stack on an Ubuntu Linux server, ensuring a stable and reliable production environment.

## My Role & Key Contributions

*   **Role:** Solo/Lead Developer
*   **Contribution 1:** Led the full-stack redevelopment, designing and implementing the Laravel backend to handle data processing, API services, and interaction with the C algorithm.
*   **Contribution 2:** Developed the new React frontend, creating a modern, responsive, and user-friendly interface for the analysis tool.
*   **Contribution 3:** Successfully containerized the legacy C algorithm using Docker, ensuring its seamless integration into the new architecture and simplifying its deployment and management.
*   **Contribution 4:** Managed the deployment of the entire application (Laravel backend, React frontend, Dockerized C algorithm) onto an Ubuntu server.
*   **Contribution 5:** Ensured the end-to-end functionality of the application, from user input through the C algorithm processing to the presentation of results.

## Technical Stack & Methodologies

*   **Programming Languages:** PHP (Laravel), JavaScript (React), C
*   **Backend Framework:** Laravel
*   **Frontend Library:** React
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Web Server:** Nginx
*   **Operating System:** Ubuntu Linux
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Outcomes & Findings (If applicable)


*   Successfully modernized and re-platformed the legacy ProteomeXchange analysis application.
*   The updated application is now live and accessible at [https://www.proteome-x.com/](https://www.proteome-x.com/).
*   Improved maintainability, scalability, and user experience compared to the original version.
*   Streamlined the deployment process through the adoption of Docker for the core C algorithm.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

This project was a significant undertaking as the solo/lead developer, providing a comprehensive experience in modernizing a legacy system with a diverse technology stack. Converting the application from an older React and Ansible-orchestrated C setup to a Laravel backend, a modern React UI, and a Dockerized C algorithm was a challenging yet rewarding process. It honed my skills in backend development with Laravel, frontend development with React, and DevOps practices with Docker and Ubuntu server management. A key learning was the importance of understanding and preserving the core functionality of a scientific algorithm (written in C) while completely overhauling the surrounding infrastructure and user interface. Furthermore, this project was a crucial experience in independently navigating and reverse-engineering an unfamiliar, legacy codebase. With none of the original developers available for consultation, I had to rely entirely on my analytical skills to understand the existing C algorithm and React components, diagnose issues, and successfully integrate them into the new architecture. This significantly boosted my confidence in tackling complex systems with limited external support. This project demonstrated my ability to manage a complex migration, integrate disparate technologies, and deliver a functional, improved application for research purposes. The successful deployment and continued operation of [https://www.proteome-x.com/](https://www.proteome-x.com/) stands as a testament to the project's success.
