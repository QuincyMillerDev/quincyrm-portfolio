## Overview / Summary

<!-- 
Provide a brief overview of the Sourcery project.
Example: "Sourcery was an internal developer tool built at UConn DXG to help streamline the creation of boilerplate code for new projects. It functioned as a command-line interface (CLI) tool and a web UI for generating project structures based on predefined templates."
-->

Sourcery ([https://sourceryapp.org/](https://sourceryapp.org/)), developed at the UConn Digital Experience Group (DXG), is a web platform designed to simplify and streamline the process for researchers and academics to request, track, and manage access to primary source documents from archives, libraries, and special collections. It aims to replace cumbersome manual request processes with a centralized, user-friendly digital solution.

## Problem Statement & Objectives

<!--
Describe the problem the project aimed to solve and the main objectives.
-->

*   **Problem:** Researchers often face a fragmented, time-consuming, and manual process when trying to access primary source documents from various archives and special collections. This includes discovering materials, submitting requests, tracking their status, and managing received documents, often involving disparate email chains and paper forms.
*   **Objective 1:** Develop a centralized web platform for researchers to easily search for and request primary source materials from participating institutions.
*   **Objective 2:** Create a user-friendly onboarding experience to guide new researchers through the platform's features and request processes.
*   **Objective 3:** Implement a robust dashboard for researchers to monitor the status of their document requests, manage communication with archivists, and access any digitized materials.
*   **Objective 4:** Provide administrative tools for archivists/institutions to manage incoming requests, track fulfillment, and communicate with researchers (though my contributions focused on the researcher-facing aspects).
*   **Objective 5:** Build a scalable and maintainable application using modern web technologies.

## My Role & Key Contributions

<!--
Describe your specific role and contributions to the Sourcery project.
-->

*   **Role:** Developer
*   **Contribution 1:** Designed and developed the researcher onboarding user flow, ensuring a smooth and intuitive experience for new users signing up and learning to navigate the platform.
*   **Contribution 2:** Developed the researcher dashboard, which served as the central hub for researchers to view and manage their document requests, track their status (e.g., pending, approved, digitized), and handle communications related to their requests.
*   **Contribution 3:** Implemented key frontend components and interactions using Vue.js and Vuetify to create a responsive and accessible user interface for the onboarding and dashboard sections.
*   **Contribution 4:** Integrated with the Supabase backend to fetch and display researcher-specific data for their dashboard and to manage user state during onboarding.

## Technical Stack & Implementation Details

<!--
List the key technologies used for Sourcery.
-->

*   **Frontend:** Vue.js, Vuetify
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL, Authentication, Realtime features)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub

## Outcomes & Achievements

<!--
Highlight the final outcomes and any notable achievements for Sourcery.
-->

*   Successfully delivered a functional onboarding flow and researcher dashboard, key components of the Sourcery platform.
*   Contributed to creating a more efficient and user-friendly way for researchers to interact with archival collections.
*   The platform ([https://sourceryapp.org/](https://sourceryapp.org/)) provides a valuable tool for the academic and research community.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

<!--
Reflect on the Sourcery project.
-->

Working on Sourcery at UConn DXG was a valuable experience in developing a user-centric platform with a clear real-world application. Developing the onboarding flow and the researcher dashboard allowed me to focus on creating intuitive interfaces that address specific user needs within a larger application. It was rewarding to contribute to a tool aimed at simplifying complex academic research processes. This project further honed my skills in Vue.js, Vuetify, and Supabase, particularly in building dynamic user interfaces and managing user-specific data. The collaborative environment at DXG and the focus on solving practical problems for users made this an impactful project to be a part of.
