# Hobby: Content Creation

## Overview / Summary

During the majority of the Covid 19 Pandemic and occasionally since, I live-streamed to twitch and produced short-form content on tiktok. My focus was video-game related, but I learned fundamental skills about content creation and social media growth, where I organically grew a community of over 10,000 across the platforms I was active on (Twitch, TikTok, Discord). Its still an interest of mine, and I envision it becoming a larger priority in my life once again. I achieved notable milestones such as 150 monthly subscribers on Twitch, a peak viewership of 1,000 concurrent viewers, and participated in significant fundraising events like the Pestily Punisher tournament, which contributed to raising over $1,000,000 for cancer research. My Twitch channel is cooliobeans.

## Learnings / Reflection

My journey into content creation, particularly during the pandemic, evolved into a key formative experience. Beyond the technical skills of streaming and video editing, it profoundly taught me about the power of community. Organically growing a following to over 10,000 individuals across Twitch, TikTok, and Discord, and then mobilizing that community for events like the Pestily Punisher charity tournament, was a powerful demonstration of what people can accomplish when they come together for a shared purpose. Witnessing our collective effort contribute to raising over a million dollars for cancer research was incredibly humbling and impactful.

This experience underscored the importance of fostering a positive, inclusive, and engaging online environment. Managing the community, facilitating discussions, and ensuring a welcoming space for everyone honed my communication and leadership skills in ways I hadn't anticipated. I learned to connect with a diverse audience, adapt my content, and genuinely engage with viewers to build lasting connections.

While I'm not currently as active in content creation, I deeply miss the vibrant community and the creative outlet it provided. The skills and lessons learned – from on-camera presence and improvisation to strategic community building and event coordination – are invaluable. I envision content creation becoming a more significant part of my life again in the future, and I am eager to find ways to integrate these passions and skills, whether through personal projects, community involvement, or even professional avenues that leverage digital engagement and community building.
