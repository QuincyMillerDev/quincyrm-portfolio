# Project: Hiring Maps (UConn DXG)

## Overview / Summary

The Hiring Maps project, co-developed at the University of Connecticut's Digital Experience Group (DXG), is an interactive web application designed to provide users with insights into the job market and various industries within Connecticut. It leverages data collected by a UConn researcher to visualize job market trends and opportunities geographically. The project aimed to create a platform for job seekers and those interested in understanding the state's economic landscape. The public repository can be found at [github.com/uconndxlab/hiring-maps](https://github.com/uconndxlab/hiring-maps). This project was completed in 2022.

## Problem Statement & Objectives

*   **Problem:** Users, including students and job seekers, lacked a centralized and interactive platform to explore and understand Connecticut's job market, industry distribution, and hiring trends based on localized data.
*   **Objective 1:** Develop an interactive map-based application to visualize job market data and industry information across Connecticut.
*   **Objective 2:** Incorporate data collected by a UConn researcher to provide valuable and specific insights into the state's employment landscape.
*   **Objective 3:** Create a user-friendly interface allowing users to navigate, filter, and understand the presented data effectively.
*   **Objective 4:** Collaborate with the data-providing researcher to ensure the application accurately represented and effectively delivered the intended information.
*   **Objective 5:** Deploy the application on reliable on-premise university infrastructure.

## My Role & Key Contributions

*   **Role:** Co-Developer (Full-Stack)
*   **Contribution 1:** Actively participated in the development of the Vue.js frontend, utilizing the Vuetify framework for UI components.
*   **Contribution 2:** Integrated Mapbox GL JS for the interactive map visualizations, displaying job market and industry data geographically.
*   **Contribution 3:** Implemented backend functionalities and data management using Supabase.
*   **Contribution 4:** Collaborated closely with another student developer and a UConn researcher, participating in weekly meetings to align the project with data insights and user needs.
*   **Contribution 5:** Assisted in setting up the hosting environment on an on-premise Linux server with NGINX, mirroring the setup for the Grant Trails project.

## Technical Stack & Implementation Details

*   **Frontend:** Vue.js, Vuetify, Mapbox GL JS
*   **Backend & Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL and serverless functions)
*   **Data Source:** Job market data collected by a UConn researcher.
*   **Deployment:** On-premises Linux server, NGINX (reverse proxy and web server)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub ([github.com/uconndxlab/hiring-maps](https://github.com/uconndxlab/hiring-maps))

## Outcomes & Achievements

*   Successfully developed and launched an interactive platform for exploring Connecticut's job market and industry data.
*   Effectively translated researcher-collected data into a user-friendly, visual tool.
*   Fostered collaboration between student developers and university researchers.
*   Delivered a functional application hosted on university infrastructure, making it accessible to its intended audience.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

Co-developing the Hiring Maps project was a valuable experience in collaborative software development and data visualization. Working with Vue.js, Vuetify, Mapbox, and Supabase allowed me to further develop my full-stack skills. The weekly meetings with the UConn researcher who collected the job market data were crucial, teaching me how to iterate on a product based on expert feedback and ensure the tool met specific data representation needs. This project emphasized the importance of clear communication in a team setting, especially when working with non-technical stakeholders to translate complex data into an accessible format. Deploying another application on the on-premise NGINX server solidified my understanding of web hosting and server management. It was rewarding to build a tool that could potentially help individuals navigate their career paths by providing insights into Connecticut's employment landscape.
