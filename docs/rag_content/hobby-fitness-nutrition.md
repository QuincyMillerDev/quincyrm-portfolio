# Hobby: Fitness & Nutrition

## Overview / Summary

Fitness and nutrition are integral and foundational aspects of my lifestyle, shaping my daily routines and long-term well-being. I am passionate about maintaining a high level of physical activity through a diverse range of pursuits including running, strength training, mobility work, and calisthenics. This is complemented by a mindful approach to nutrition, involving periodic macronutrient tracking and consistent meal prepping to support my activity levels and health goals. I enjoy the process of tracking my activities and biometrics, primarily using my Garmin watch, to understand progress and stay motivated.

## Key Aspects & Activities

*   **Strength Training:** Consistent lifting regimen focusing on compound movements and functional strength, incorporating elements of bodybuilding for hypertrophy and calisthenics for bodyweight mastery. Training sessions are structured to ensure progressive overload and balanced development.
*   **Running & Endurance:** Regular running, varying from shorter daily runs to longer endurance efforts. I enjoy hiking and general outdoor activities, culminating in achievements like completing the 20-mile Presidential Traverse in New Hampshire in 18 hours.
*   **Mobility & General Activity:** Dedicated focus on mobility work to support performance and prevent injury. I prioritize an active lifestyle that includes daily walking and embracing various physical activities.
*   **Nutrition Philosophy:** Mindful and performance-oriented approach to nutrition. I periodically track macronutrients using Cronometer to ensure I'm meeting my energy and recovery needs. Meal prepping is a staple in my routine, allowing for consistent, healthy eating habits.
*   **Data Tracking & Analysis:** Utilize a Garmin watch for comprehensive activity and biometric tracking (e.g., heart rate, sleep, stress levels). Periodically use Cronometer for detailed macronutrient and micronutrient analysis.
*   **Future Aspirations:** Continuously seeking new challenges, with goals such as running a full marathon and potentially competing in a Hyrox fitness race.

## Tools & Technologies Used

*   Garmin Watch: For daily activity tracking, run/hike logging, sleep analysis, and heart rate monitoring.
*   Cronometer: For periodic macronutrient and micronutrient tracking and analysis.

## Learnings / Reflection

My commitment to fitness and nutrition has instilled a deep sense of discipline, resilience, and an appreciation for long-term consistency. Tracking activities and nutrition has not only optimized my physical well-being but also sharpened my analytical skills, drawing parallels to the data-driven approach in engineering. The challenge of endurance activities like the Presidential Traverse has taught me invaluable lessons about mental fortitude and pushing perceived limits.

This lifestyle is not just about physical health; it significantly contributes to my mental clarity, focus, and overall energy levels, positively impacting all areas of my life, including my professional work. The pursuit of future goals like a marathon or a Hyrox competition keeps me motivated and constantly learning about training methodologies and nutritional science. It's a continuous journey of self-improvement and discovering what my body and mind are capable of. Sometimes some physical activity is all you need to solve a problem that youre stuck on. I think its critical to being a good problem-solver.
