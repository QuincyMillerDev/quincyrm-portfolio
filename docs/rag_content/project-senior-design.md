# Project: Senior Design Capstone - Multimodal Care Coordinator


## Overview / Summary


My senior design project, the "Multimodal Care Coordinator," was developed for our corporate sponsor, Bastion Health ([https://www.getbastion.com/](https://www.getbastion.com/)), a telehealth company specializing in men's prostate health. Our team of five students developed a multi-faceted solution: a multi-modal chatbot to assist new patients with onboarding, appointment management, and understanding healthcare packages, alongside a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for Bastion Health's medical professionals to query internal company documents using natural language. This project culminated in winning 3rd place out of 31 teams in the UConn Computer Science Senior Design Competition, a significant achievement as CS is the largest engineering major. The project repository can be found at [https://github.com/QuincyMillerDev/Multimodal-Care-Coordinator](https://github.com/QuincyMillerDev/Multimodal-Care-Coordinator).

## Problem Statement & Objectives


*   **Problem:** Bastion Health needed an efficient way to onboard new patients, manage their care journey, and provide their contracted medical professionals with quick access to information within company documents. The existing processes required manual intervention and lacked the immediate, interactive support that modern AI-powered tools could offer.
*   **Objective 1:** Develop a multi-modal chatbot for patients to handle tasks like onboarding, appointment scheduling, and information retrieval about their healthcare plans.
*   **Objective 2:** Create a RAG-based chatbot interface for telehealth professionals to query company documents (e.g., privacy policies, treatment protocols) in natural language, improving information accessibility and efficiency.
*   **Objective 3:** Design and implement a robust full-stack application architecture leveraging modern AI and web technologies.
*   **Objective 4:** Implement an Agile development workflow to manage the project, accommodate varying team member experience levels, and ensure timely deliverables.
*   **Objective 5:** Successfully deploy and present a live demo of the application at the Senior Design Competition.

## My Role & Key Contributions


*   **Role:** Lead Developer
*   **Contribution 1:** Stepped up to lead development efforts due to being the only team member with prior extensive software engineering experience (from UConn DXG and Hubbell internships).
*   **Contribution 2:** Designed the complete technical architecture, selecting the tech stack including Vue.js, FastAPI, OpenAI LLMs, Langchain, Pinecone, and Docker.
*   **Contribution 3:** Implemented approximately 80% of the project's codebase, including the core backend logic, frontend components, AI integrations, and the PDF-to-embedding pipeline for the RAG system.
*   **Contribution 4:** Established and managed an Agile development workflow, including creating a project board, writing user stories, delegating tasks, and conducting weekly team standups in addition to weekly sponsor meetings with the Bastion Health CTO.
*   **Contribution 5:** Mentored teammates, helping them understand new concepts and overcome technical hurdles, and effectively delegated non-coding tasks (e.g., technical writing, diagram creation) based on individual strengths.
*   **Contribution 6:** Containerized the application using Docker to provide preview builds to the CTO and for final deployment.
*   **Contribution 7:** Managed sponsor expectations regarding deliverables, balancing the project with other academic responsibilities of the team.

## Technical Details & Technologies Used


*   **Frontend:** Vue.js (specifically Vue 3), Vuetify, TypeScript
*   **Backend:** Python with FastAPI
*   **AI/LLM:** OpenAI (for Large Language Models)
*   **LLM Orchestration:** Langchain
*   **Vector Database:** Pinecone (for RAG embeddings)
*   **Data Processing:** Custom Python scripts for PDF parsing and embedding generation
*   **Containerization:** Docker, Docker Compose
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
*   **Methodologies:** Agile (Scrum-inspired with project board, user stories, weekly standups)

## Outcomes & Achievements


*   Successfully developed and delivered a functional multi-modal care coordinator and RAG chatbot system that met the core requirements of Bastion Health.
*   Presented a live demo of the fully operational application at the UConn Senior Design Competition.
*   **Won 3rd place out of 31 Computer Science projects** in the Senior Design Competition, a major accomplishment given the size and competitiveness of the program.
*   Effectively managed and led a team with diverse skill levels to a successful project completion.
*   Provided the sponsor (Bastion Health CTO) with regular updates and preview builds using Docker.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection


This Senior Design project was an incredibly fulfilling and pivotal experience. It was the culmination of all the software engineering knowledge and practical skills I had gained throughout my university career, including my work at DXG and internships at Hubbell. Leading this project ignited my passion for generative AI and its practical applications in solving real-world problems.

The primary challenge was not just technical but also managerial. Being the only member with substantial prior experience, I quickly learned the importance of leadership, clear communication, and effective delegation. Instituting an Agile workflow was crucial for productivity and for helping my teammates contribute meaningfully, even if their strengths lay outside of direct coding. I learned to identify and leverage those strengths, such as tasking a colleague with technical writing for our graded paper or another with creating architectural diagrams. This experience taught me how to temper external expectations (from the CTO) while motivating and guiding a team through a demanding, two-semester project alongside other coursework.

Designing the entire tech stack and writing a significant portion of the code (around 80%) was a massive undertaking but also immensely rewarding. Integrating technologies like Vue.js, FastAPI, Langchain, OpenAI, and Pinecone into a cohesive system, and then containerizing it with Docker, solidified my full-stack and MLOps capabilities.

The proudest moment was undoubtedly winning 3rd place in the Senior Design Competition. Given the effort, the challenges overcome with the team, and the scale of the competition (UConn CS being the largest engineering major), it was a significant validation of our hard work and the innovative solution we built. This project was not just an academic requirement but a profound learning experience in technical leadership, project management, and the transformative potential of AI. I am incredibly proud of what my team and I accomplished.
