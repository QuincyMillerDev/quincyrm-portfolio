# Project: Grant Trails (UConn DXG)

## Overview / Summary

The Grant Trails project, developed at the University of Connecticut's Digital Experience Group (DXG) in 2022, is a web application designed to visualize the economic impact of research grants awarded to UConn faculty. It revived and modernized an older concept, providing an interactive map that displays where grant dollars were spent within Connecticut, thereby showcasing the university's contribution to the local economy. The application can be viewed at [granttrails.core.uconn.edu](https://granttrails.core.uconn.edu/). This project was completed in 2022.

## Problem Statement & Objectives

*   **Problem:** An existing, older web application for tracking and displaying university grant distributions was outdated and needed to be revived and modernized. There was a need to effectively communicate how research grant funding supports local economies, a aspect often overlooked.
*   **Objective 1:** Develop a user-friendly, interactive web application to visualize the geographic distribution of UConn grant spending within Connecticut.
*   **Objective 2:** Allow users to explore grant data through an interactive map, with capabilities to filter by year and fund type.
*   **Objective 3:** Provide clear information about the project's purpose, explaining how grant dollars contribute to the local economy by funding equipment, salaries, and other resources.
*   **Objective 4:** Ensure the application was robust and could be hosted reliably on university infrastructure.

## My Role & Key Contributions

*   **Role:** Full-Stack Developer
*   **Contribution 1:** Led the entire development of the Grant Trails web application using Vue.js for the frontend.
*   **Contribution 2:** Integrated Mapbox GL JS for creating an interactive map visualization of grant data, allowing users to pan, zoom, and explore data points.
*   **Contribution 3:** Utilized Supabase for data storage and serverless backend functionalities, managing the grant data displayed on the map.
*   **Contribution 4:** Successfully developed and delivered the entire application within a few weeks in 2022.
*   **Contribution 5:** Set up hosting for the application on an on-premises Linux server, including configuring NGINX as a reverse proxy.

## Technical Stack & Implementation Details

*   **Frontend:** Vue.js, Mapbox GL JS
*   **Backend & Data:** Supabase (PostgreSQL database, serverless functions)
*   **Deployment:** On-premises Linux server, NGINX (reverse proxy and web server)
*   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
*   **Data Source:** Data on UConn grant spending, visualized geographically.

## Outcomes & Achievements

*   Successfully revived and launched a modernized Grant Trails web application ([granttrails.core.uconn.edu](https://granttrails.core.uconn.edu/)), showcasing UConn's economic impact.
*   Delivered a fully functional application in a short timeframe (a few weeks).
*   Provided an intuitive interface for users to explore complex grant data geographically.
*   Established a stable hosting environment for the application using on-premise infrastructure.
*   The project is open source and serves as a model for other universities.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

Developing Grant Trails was a rewarding full-stack experience at UConn DXG. It allowed me to take full ownership of a project, from conceptualization based on a previous iteration to deployment. Revitalizing the application to clearly demonstrate the economic benefits of university research grants was impactful. Working with Vue.js, Mapbox for geospatial visualization, and Supabase for a modern backend solution within a compressed timeframe significantly honed my rapid development and integration skills. Setting up the on-premise Linux server with NGINX provided valuable DevOps experience. This project highlighted the power of web technologies to make complex data accessible and understandable to a broader audience, and I'm proud to have delivered a tool that showcases UConn's positive influence on the state's economy.
