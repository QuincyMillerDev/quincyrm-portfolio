# Activity: Volunteer Rowing Coaching & Involvement

## Overview / Summary

Rowing has been a significant part of my life, deeply influenced by my mother, our community's crew coach and my former high school coach. While I've always assisted her in building the program, my most impactful volunteer experience was during the Fall 2024 season. This season was particularly special as I served as a volunteer coach and rowing partner for Scout, a 16-year-old girl who has been blind since birth. It was her inaugural competitive season, and our program, Coventry Lake Community Rowing (CLCR), had the remarkable opportunity to compete in the PR3 Inclusion Doubles race at the prestigious Head of The Charles Regatta.

I practiced and coached Scout three days a week throughout the season, focusing on adapting techniques and building her confidence on the water. Our journey culminated in our joint participation at the Head of The Charles, where we achieved a competitive time of 26:53. This experience was not only a significant milestone for CLCR's inclusivity but also an indescribable achievement for Scout. It stands out as one of the most profound and rewarding experiences of my life, highlighting the power of adaptive sports and dedicated mentorship.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

Volunteering with CLCR in the Fall 2024 season, particularly coaching and rowing with Scout, was an extraordinarily transformative experience. Witnessing Scout's journey from a novice rower to a Head of The Charles competitor was incredibly inspiring and instilled in me a profound appreciation for the power of adaptive sports and inclusive coaching. This role demanded a new level of patience, creativity, and communication, pushing me to adapt my existing rowing knowledge and coaching style in ways I hadn't anticipated.

I learned the importance of precise verbal cues and the necessity of building deep trust with an athlete who relies on senses other than sight to navigate and perform. The experience significantly enhanced my ability to communicate complex technical details clearly and effectively. More than just developing skills, this journey taught me about resilience, the human capacity to overcome significant challenges, and the immense joy found in shared achievement. Helping Scout realize her potential and seeing the positive impact on her confidence and on our rowing community was immensely rewarding. It solidified my belief in the importance of creating accessible opportunities in sports and has motivated me to continue seeking ways to contribute to inclusive athletic endeavors.
