# Experience: Travel

## Overview / Summary

I love to travel. I think that if you're young and physically fit travelling is  a necessity. The memories you build are once in a lifetime, and its important to explore the world because it is a really big place out there with a lot of interesting cultures and people. Everyone should be able to experience it for themselves and I have never personally regretted a trip.

## Key Destinations & Experiences

*   **Destination 1: Japan, Summer 2024**
    * Japan is the coolest place I have ever been. Navigating a country on the opposite side of the world with a language barrier was a life-changing experience. I have had some of the best meals and experiences of my life there. I was lucky enough to go to Tokyo, Osaka, and Kyoto. Some of my favorite places were Nara Japan, The Fushimi Inari Shrines, Shinjuku, Shibuya, etc. I loved the ramen.

*   **Destination 2:European Backpacking Trip - May 2024 (Amsterdam, Prague, Vienna, Berlin, Venice)
    * In 8 days I went to those 5 cities on a backpacking trip. Another life-changing experience and I loved how many different cultures there were and how much it changed from city to city.

*   **Destination 3: Costa Rica, Summer 2022**
    * Went on a family trip to Costa Rica, traveling across the country and trying a plethora of activities such as ziplining, white-water rafting, jetskiing, surfboarding, etc. The food was the best part and I think its incredible how commited the people of the country are too a green-lifestyle and combating climate change.

## Travel Style & Preferences

I prefer immersive travel, often opting for local experiences over tourist hotspots. I enjoy planning my own itineraries and am comfortable with both solo and group travel. Its all about meeting people for me.

## Learnings / Reflection from Travel

Travel has broadened my worldview, improved my cross-cultural communication skills, and made me more resilient and open-minded. These experiences indirectly benefit my professional life by fostering creativity and adaptability. I really do believe that traveling has made me more adaptable to all kinds of difficult situations and resiliant to when things get hard.
