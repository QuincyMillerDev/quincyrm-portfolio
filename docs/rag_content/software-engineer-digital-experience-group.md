# Work Experience: Software Engineer at UConn Digital Experience Group

## Overview / Summary

From 2022 to 2024, I worked as a Software Engineer at the University of Connecticut's Digital Experience Group (DXG) in Storrs, CT. DXG operates as a University service center, dedicated to "Supporting Research at UConn Through Digital Innovation" by providing high-quality app development, web design, UI/UX design, and other technology innovation services to the UConn research community ([https://dxgroup.core.uconn.edu/](https://dxgroup.core.uconn.edu/)). In this role, I contributed to a variety of impactful projects, often taking on full-stack development responsibilities and sometimes leading project development, to deliver innovative digital solutions for UConn researchers and departments.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

*   **Full-Stack Development of Research-Driven Applications:** Developed and co-developed multiple web applications catering to diverse research needs. This included:
    *   **Grant Trails:** Led the full-stack development of a web app to visualize UConn grant spending, utilizing Vue.js, Mapbox GL JS, and Supabase. Delivered a fully functional application within a few weeks.
    *   **Hiring Maps:** Co-developed an interactive map application (Vue.js, Vuetify, Mapbox GL JS, Supabase) to visualize job market data for UConn researchers.
    *   **Sourcery:** Contributed to the Sourcery platform ([https://sourceryapp.org/](https://sourceryapp.org/)) by developing the researcher onboarding user flow and dashboard using Vue.js, Vuetify, and Supabase, streamlining access to archival documents.
*   **Modernization of Legacy Systems & Complex Integrations:**
    *   **ProteomeX:** As solo/lead developer, re-architected and modernized a legacy React and C-based bioinformatics application into a Laravel backend, modern React UI, and Dockerized C algorithm, deployed on an Ubuntu server with NGINX. Successfully navigated an unfamiliar codebase without original developer support.
    *   **Landscape Architecture Topography Visualizer:** Co-developed an MVP for a complex data pipeline involving iPhone LiDAR scans, C++/OpenGL for 3D data processing, a Node.js/Express.js backend, and a Vue.js/D3.js frontend. This MVP was instrumental in securing further research funding.
*   **System Architecture & Deployment:** Designed and contributed to system architectures for various projects. Gained experience deploying applications using NGINX on Linux servers and containerizing components with Docker.
*   **Collaboration & Problem Solving:** Worked closely with UConn researchers, fellow student developers, and DXG staff to understand requirements, design solutions, and overcome technical challenges across a wide range of technologies and project scopes.

## Skills Utilized / Developed

*   **Technical Skills:**
    *   **Frontend Development:** Vue.js (primary), React, Vuetify, Mapbox GL JS, D3.js, HTML5, CSS3.
    *   **Backend Development:** Node.js (Express.js), Laravel (PHP), Supabase (BaaS).
    *   **Programming Languages:** JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, PHP, C/C++ (for specific project components).
    *   **Databases:** PostgreSQL (via Supabase).
    *   **DevOps & Deployment:** NGINX, Docker, Linux Server Management (Ubuntu).
    *   **Version Control:** Git, GitHub.
    *   **Data Visualization:** Implemented interactive maps and data-driven visual displays.
    *   **API Integration & Design:** Worked with and developed backend APIs.
*   **Soft Skills / Methodologies:**
    *   Full-Stack Development, Rapid Prototyping, Agile Principles.
    *   Collaboration with Researchers & Non-Technical Stakeholders.
    *   Problem-Solving in Complex Technical Environments.
    *   Adaptability to Diverse Project Requirements & Technologies.
    *   Project & Task Management, often in self-directed or lead roles.
    *   Reverse-Engineering & Modernizing Legacy Code.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection

My time at the UConn Digital Experience Group was incredibly formative, providing a dynamic environment to apply and expand my software engineering skills on real-world projects with direct impact on the university's research community. I had the opportunity to work across the full stack, from designing user interfaces with Vue.js and React to building backend services with Node.js, Laravel, and Supabase, and deploying applications on Linux servers with NGINX and Docker. 

Leading the development of Grant Trails and the ProteomeX modernization, and co-developing complex projects like the Landscape Architecture visualizer and Hiring Maps, taught me invaluable lessons in project ownership, rapid development, and navigating technical complexity. Specifically, the ProteomeX project was a significant learning experience in reverse-engineering and modernizing a legacy system without direct support from its original creators. Contributing to tools like Sourcery, aimed at improving researcher workflows, was also very rewarding. DXG fostered a collaborative and innovative atmosphere where I could tackle diverse challenges, significantly enhancing my technical versatility and problem-solving abilities before transitioning into my first post-graduation role.
