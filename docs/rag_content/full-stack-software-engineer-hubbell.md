# Work Experience: Full-Stack Software Engineer at Hubbell Inc.

## Overview / Summary At Hubbell Full-time

My most recent job, starting in July 2024, my role as a Full-Stack Software Engineer at Hubbell Incorporated marked my first professional position post-graduation, laying a robust foundation for my software engineering career. I was dedicated to a singular, high-impact NPX (New Product Experimentation) project aimed at driving significant company growth. This role was heavily involved in data engineering, requiring the design and implementation of data processing pipelines and management of large datasets alongside full-stack feature development. Operating within an agile framework, I took full ownership of user stories and feature development, collaborating effectively with diverse stakeholders, including my immediate team and international research teams, such as the one based in Spain.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements At Hubbell Full-time

*   **Enhanced Cloud Architecture via Terraform Refactoring:** Spearheaded a critical refactoring of the Terraform repository, transitioning to a modular and resilient cloud architecture. This initiative resolved persistent deployment blockages, notably for UI-critical resources like the PostgreSQL server, by decomposing the monolithic state into smaller, scoped modules. **Impact:** Decoupled dependencies, significantly improved IaC stability, and drastically reduced developer hours previously lost to manual state file interventions, leading to more reliable Databricks workspace deployments.
*   **Led Productionalization of Core Network Algorithm & Data Pipeline:** Successfully productionalized a complex meter-to-transformer network topology correction algorithm. This involved architecting a Python SDK for topology data management, designing and implementing a scalable Databricks data pipeline leveraging Apache Spark for efficient large-scale data processing (handling hundreds of millions of data points), and integrating the algorithm's outputs with our .NET Web API and Angular frontend. **Impact:** Delivered an end-to-end solution that enabled power utility customers to visualize corrected network topologies, directly contributing to securing the project's second beta customer and validating the commercial viability of the research.
*   **Accelerated Team Performance through Mentorship & Knowledge Transfer:** Actively mentored team members, including a senior developer (17 YOE) new to the project, by providing comprehensive onboarding on project architecture, Databricks workflows, and domain-specific knowledge. Simultaneously, engaged in Hubbell's formal mentorship program, receiving weekly guidance from the project lead (Staff Engineer) to accelerate early-career development and navigate complex technical/strategic challenges. **Impact:** Facilitated faster ramp-up for new team members and fostered a collaborative environment, while also rapidly developing personal technical and strategic capabilities.
*   **Strengthened Knowledge Base with Comprehensive Technical Documentation:** Authored and maintained critical technical documentation, including onboarding guides, detailed system architecture diagrams, and operational runbooks for infrastructure and DevOps. **Impact:** Ensured knowledge continuity, streamlined onboarding for new engineers, and improved team efficiency by providing clear, accessible technical resources.
*   **Boosted Development Velocity with CI/CD Pipeline Overhaul:** Re-engineered the Azure DevOps CI/CD pipeline to resolve critical failures in PyTest unit test execution. Implemented a comprehensive solution involving parallel test execution across multiple Azure Build agents (self-hosted VM Scale-set) and integrated code quality gates (coverage and deprecated method reports). **Impact:** Achieved an 80% reduction in PR CI/CD build times, significantly accelerating development cycles and improving the speed of feedback loops for the engineering team.

## Positive Impact / Learnings / Reflection At Hubbell Full-time

My tenure at Hubbell Inc. was a period of immense professional growth and impactful contributions. Taking ownership of critical infrastructure improvements, like the Terraform refactor and CI/CD pipeline optimization, not only solved pressing technical challenges but also tangibly improved team productivity and system reliability. Leading the productionalization of the meter-to-transformer algorithm was a highlight, offering a deep dive into full-stack architecture, robust data engineering with Spark (including designing scalable data pipelines and managing large-scale data processing), and cross-cultural team collaboration. This experience honed my ability to translate complex research into a viable, customer-facing product, directly contributing to key business objectives like onboarding a beta customer, and solidified my skills in both software and data engineering disciplines.

Mentoring a senior colleague was a rewarding experience that underscored the value of diverse experiences and the importance of clear communication in knowledge transfer. Simultaneously, participating in Hubbell's formal mentorship program was invaluable for my early career trajectory. The dedicated guidance from our project lead provided crucial insights into enterprise-level software development, strategic decision-making, and navigating complex technical landscapes involving both application development and data-intensive systems. This dual experience of both providing and receiving mentorship accelerated my learning curve significantly, reinforcing the importance of continuous learning, robust testing, comprehensive documentation, and proactive problem-solving in a fast-paced agile environment. This role solidified my passion for building scalable, high-quality software and data solutions, and tackling complex technical challenges head-on, while also emphasizing the importance of teamwork, strategic thinking, and a culture of continuous improvement.

Additionally my manager Mark, was a key highlight of the experience. Without his support I wouldn't have reached of success at Hubbell that I did.
